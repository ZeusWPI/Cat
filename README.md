## Development
### Database
* ENUM TYPE

    Because of the lack of typing in clojure and the forced typing of the jdbc driver
we need to manually manage conversion of enum types to clojure keywords.

    When adding an enum to the database, make sure to add it to the '+schema-enums+' set [src/clj/cat/db/core.clj]
